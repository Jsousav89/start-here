## Beyond

The remainder of the workshop puts you in the driver's seat. Based on the fundamentals you have acquired, are you ready to complete challenges without code samples provided? In each of the following challenges, start with a new HTML file named however you want. Copy and paste relevant markup and code from your **HEREJS.HTML** file to help start. For help with some of the tasks, please consult https://developer.here.com/api-explorer/maps-js/v3.0

### CHALLENGE: Multi-City Markers

Create a map of the USA where 5 cities of your choice are marked. Do not hard-code the latitude|longitude into the code (use geocode).

### CHALLENGE: Connect the Cities

Using the previous challenge as a base, connect the 5 cities with [polylines](https://developer.here.com/api-explorer/maps-js/v3.0/geoshapes/polyline-on-the-map). For more challenge, change the color of the lines to something different.

### CHALLENGE: Routing

Starting from scratch, choose two addresses in the USA (for example, your home address and work address). Using the [routing example](https://developer.here.com/api-explorer/maps-js/v3.0/servicesRouting/map-with-route-from-a-to-b), establish a route between the two. For more challenge, add a third city!
