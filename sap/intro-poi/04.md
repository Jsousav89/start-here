Save your work. You have created a new destination to allow the HERE Places API to be used in an SAPUI5 project.

### Configure Destination

Open your project from the previous workshop. Find the "neo-app.json" file and add the following node to support the Places destination created in previous step:


``` javascript
    {
    	"path": "/places",
        "target": {
        	"type": "destination",
        	"name": "Places",
        	"entryPath": "/"
    	},
    	"description": "Places"
    }
```

Your new node should be placed in JSON as shown here:

![sap new app](./sap_places_neoapp.jpg)

Save changes.
